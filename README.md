# SINH Is Not Haskell, a toy programming language

Assignment 4 (tutorial 6) submission for **COMP3259 Principles of Programming Languages, HKU 2015**

## Additional features implemented

I implemented the optional question so running recursive functions works. Try running eg. `examples/recursive.sinh`.

I also rewrote a lot of the pre-given code to use monadic composition instead of verbose pattern matching as I wanted a clearer picture of how it all works. Functionality should be the same though.

I think this assignment was considerably easier than the previous ones, you gave most of the code in the tutorial...

## Usage

    make
    ./Main examples/recursive.sinh
